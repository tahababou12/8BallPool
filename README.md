<hr>

A Typescript remake of the known "Classic Pool Game".

> This game has a very simple to use and a friendly UI. 
> And doesn't require much skills in playing this game, if you're bored, 
> you can invite someone in your household or perhaps your special someone to play billiard or if you want a challenging one, > you had the option to play against an AI at different difficulty, 
> I guess billiards enthusiast would definitely love this.
> Joseph Ace Tigas

> Chen Shmilovich made a very nice looking pool game with JS and HTML5.
