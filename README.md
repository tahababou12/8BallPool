A Typescript remake of the known "Classic Pool Game".

> _This game has a very simple to use and a friendly UI._ 
> _And doesn't require much skills in playing this game, if you're bored,_
> _you can invite someone in your household or perhaps your special someone to play billiard or if you want a challenging one,_ 
> _you had the option to play against an AI at different difficulty,_ 
> _I guess billiards enthusiast would definitely love this._

> _Joseph Ace Tigas_

> _Chen Shmilovich made a very nice looking pool game with JS and HTML5._
